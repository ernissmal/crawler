## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Solo Professional:** Entrepreneur, freelancer, consultant, or sales professional who currently relies on manual research and spreadsheets. Needs cost-effective lead generation without enterprise tool complexity. Values speed, reliability, and direct Notion integration over advanced features. Comfortable with developer tools and Docker.

### Usability Goals

1. **Speed of execution:** Complete search-to-sync workflow in under 3 minutes
2. **Minimal learning curve:** New users productive within first session
3. **Transparency:** Clear visibility into what's being scraped, deduplicated, and synced
4. **Error resilience:** Graceful handling of failed scrapes with actionable feedback

### Design Principles

1. **Utility over aesthetics** - Function comes first; clean is beautiful
2. **Immediate feedback** - Every action shows its result instantly
3. **Single source of truth** - Notion is the database; UI is just the interface
4. **Progressive disclosure** - Advanced options hidden until needed
5. **Fail gracefully** - Errors explain themselves and suggest next steps
